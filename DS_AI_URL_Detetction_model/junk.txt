The proliferation of online platforms has made detecting fraudulent websites a critical challenge. Initially, our approach focused on identifying fraud websites based on URL features. However, as cybercriminals adopted techniques to craft legitimate-looking URLs, we extended our system to analyze website content. Our enhanced methodology involves scraping webpage content and performing sentiment analysis using Twitter RoBERTa to assess intent and detect anomalies. Additionally, we evaluate the confidence of organizational names referenced on the website to determine their relevance and legitimacy. Spelling checks are also implemented to identify subtle yet consistent errors that often signal fraud. This multi-faceted approach strengthens the detection of deceptive websites, addressing both URL-based and content-based fraud vectors, and offers a comprehensive solution for mitigating online threats.
